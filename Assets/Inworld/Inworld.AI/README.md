# inworld-unity
This is the Lite version of Inworld SDK that supports lightweight projects with a significantly smaller download size. 

It does not include any character models from ReadyPlayerMe or Inworld avatars, so is suitable for developers with capabilities to import their own character skeletons and animations in Unity. Ideal for WebGL deployments or projects where package size is a consideration.
